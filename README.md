# RAILWAY-RESERVATION-SYSTEM
The system allows users to  search for trains by date, destination, and class, and then proceed to book tickets. The project ensures a smooth interaction between passengers and the railway database, focusing on accessibility and performance.

This project is developed using Python for the backend and can be integrated with SQL databases for data storage. It provides an excellent foundation for anyone looking to understand how reservation systems function and offers opportunities to extend the project with additional features like seat selection, payment integration, and train schedule updates.
